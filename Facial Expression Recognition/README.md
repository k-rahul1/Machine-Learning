#Facial Expression Recognition

This implementation detects human facial expression of 7 types:
'Angry','Disgust','Fear','Happy','Sad','Surprise','Neutral'
The network is customized and is based on vgg16 and trained on FER2013 kaggle dataset.

Following files are available:
1. VGG1_CNNfer2013.ipynb : Jupyter notebook of implementation of facial expression recognition using CNN
2. testImages : Sample images downloaded from internet to test the network
3. Research Paper: Details of our work

#Dependencies:
->Pytorch
->OpenCV
->CUDA(if training to be done using GPU)

#Instructions:
The Jupyter notebook contains all the codes.
To run it, just click on start.

**Note: Make sure to keep all the folder contents at one place.
